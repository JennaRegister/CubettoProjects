# The Cubetto Projects
#### (sounds like a CIA mission)
We have a task where the primitives are defined but undiscovered, the participant is free to explore the operations, make proposals, and "debug" their work. Eventually, they may be able to edit their keyboard of operations by composing their own, helpful primitives (presumably if they reuse a program often, and there is some reward for shorter programs).

### TODO:
* Come up with the trials (right now they randomly place the star)
* Record to a file: list of tile choices and RT
* Add in a portion of the task where it is simply predetermined animation, not participant interactive.
* Integrate back to PsiTurk (easy)
* **Testable predictions** (what does the plot look like? what is the paper **about**?)


## Mutual Exclusivity
If we introduce a new tile, will participants automatically assume it does something different than the other tiles? Can we see what they assume it does based on their choices?

## Proposals are interesting
Can we come up with a model of how participants explore this space?

## "Debugging"
If they make a mistake, what parts of their program do they "keep"?

## Composing Functions
How far will participants go when composing functions? Will they keep whole algorithms, or small (helpful) pieces?

## Similarity Judgments
After the exploration phase of the task, show some of our own programs (animations of the bee and light up of the tiles). Ask participant to judge similarity. How do their similarity judgments relate to their exploration in the task? More transformations on their exploration == less similarity?
